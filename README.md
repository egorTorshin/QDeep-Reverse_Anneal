# Reverse Anneal

This notebook explains and demonstrates the reverse-anneal feature.

Reverse annealing is a technique that makes it possible to refine known good local
solutions, thereby increasing performance for certain applications. It comprises
(1) annealing backward from a known classical state to a mid-anneal state of
quantum superposition, (2) searching for optimum solutions at this mid-anneal
point while in the presence of an increased transverse field (quantum state), and
then (3) proceeding forward to a new classical state at the end of the anneal.

The notebook has the following sections:

1. **The Reverse Anneal Feature** explains the feature and its parameters.
2. **Using the Reverse Anneal Feature** demonstrates the use of the feature on a
   random example problem.
3. **Analysis on a 16-Bit Problem** uses reverse annealing on a known problem and
   compares the results with other anneal methods.
4. **Modulating the Reverse-Annealing Parameters** provides code that lets you
   sweep through various anneal schedules to explore the effect on results.
